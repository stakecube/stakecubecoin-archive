What is Stakecube (SCC) ?
-------------------------

Stakecube is a fork of the PIVX codebase; which uses a combination of Masternodes with PoS (Proof of stake) to secure the cryptocurrency network.

The first consequtive blocks contain premine; and additionally the coins allocated for the user coin swap, destined for holders of the previous PoW/PoS version of Stakecube.

A total of 1000 SC is required to run a masternode; while the minimum stake age has been set to one hour.
